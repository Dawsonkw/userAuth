# User Authentication component
this is a simple user authentication component built using react and tailwindcss. The goal is for practice in building out components for react. I plan on working with email / password authentication and finding an API to handle authentication. Ideally I will be adding email validation, a password reset feature and a create an account feature to explore the basics of User authentication. 

Update; I am using the react-hook-form api for the authentication.
